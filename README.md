This is a simple interactive version of the classic Knight Swap Puzzle, inspired by the Mind Your Decisions YouTube channel.

## 🎯 Purpose
I wanted to try the puzzle digitally instead of using pen and paper, so I built this version with the help of AI.

You can:
- Move knights by clicking
- See valid moves highlighted
- View starting & solved positions
- Undo / reset moves
- Automatically detect puzzle completion
