# Knight Swap Puzzle

This is a simple interactive version of the classic **Knight Swap Puzzle**, inspired by the Mind Your Decisions YouTube channel.

## 🎯 Motive / Purpose
I wanted to *try and play the puzzle first* rather than solve it on paper, so I built this digital version with help from AI.  
It lets you:
- Click and move knights.
- View the starting and solved positions.
- Undo and reset moves.
- Automatically detect when the puzzle is solved.
